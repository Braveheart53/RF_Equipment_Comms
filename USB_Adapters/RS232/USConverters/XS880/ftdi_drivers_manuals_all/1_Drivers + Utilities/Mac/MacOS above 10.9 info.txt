Since Mac OS Mavericks (10.9), Apple has included their own version of the FTDI VCP driver in the kernel. 

With an FTDI based device plugged in,  you can find the VCP driver in the /dev directory as tty.usbserial-FTxxxxxx 

You still have the option of using the latest dext installer with Mac OS 15:
